     <p>A farm is an area of land that is devoted primarily to agricultural
         processes with the primary objective of producing food and other crops; it is the basic facility in food
         production.[1] The name is used for specialised units such as arable farms, vegetable farms, fruit farms,
         dairy, pig and poultry farms, and land used for the production of natural fibres, biofuel and other commodities.
         It includes ranches, feedlots, orchards, plantations and estates, smallholdings and hobby farms, and includes the
         farmhouse and agricultural buildings as well as the land In modern times the term has been extended
         so as to include such industrial operations as wind farms and fish farms, both of which can operate on land or sea.
         Farming originated independently in different parts of the world, as hunter gatherer societies transitioned to food
         production rather than, food capture. It may have started about 12,000 years ago with the domestication of
         livestock in the Fertile Crescent in western Asia, soon to be followed by the cultivation of crops.
         Modern units tend to specialise in the crops or livestock best suited to the region, with their finished
         products being sold for the retail market or for further processing, with farm products being traded around the world.
         Modern farms in developed countries are highly mechanized. In the United States, livestock may be raised on rangeland
         and finished in feedlots and the mechanization of crop production has brought about a great decrease in the number
         of agricultural workers needed. In Europe, traditional family farms are giving way to larger production units.
         In Australia, some farms are very large because the land is unable to support a high stocking density of livestock
         because of climatic conditions. In less developed countries, small farms are the norm, and the majority of rural
         residents are subsistence farmers, feeding their families and selling any surplus products in the local market.</p>
